feat: A bit about me

Hello World!
I hope some day in the future, I can read this repo and smile when comparing the me of today with the me of the future! If I smile when reading this, it will mean my path to Data Science has been successful.

But, even if I don't collaborate too much because I don't know how to, or because I don't reach the level of knowledge needed to help others, at least I hope that I will have been able to apply most of these hands-on experiences to my future work. That will be quite a success as well.

I'm sure this is going to be very challenging, and awesome. Because continuos learning is the only path worth taking. 

Let's get to it!
